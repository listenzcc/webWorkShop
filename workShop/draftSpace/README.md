## Draft Space

The projects in the work shop need some coding draft to test something.
And I would like to track them down.
As a result, the space is to practice the notebook work,
accordingly, the jupyter notebook will be used.

To avoid the notebook files overflow the language statistics in github,
since the files are always of too-large size.
I have marked the folder as **linguist-vendored** in the **.gitattributes** file.
