## Choropleth Maps

Draw interactive maps using geoData of choropleth map.

The geoData of choropleth map is stored in the **sync** folder.

### Sync Folder

The sync folder setting is an experimental method.
It allows programmers accessing to their **large-in-size** files easily across different machines or even platforms.
The aim of the setting is to keep the files in the same structure and being easily transformed and synchronized.

The current state is crude,

- The folder is some folder on the disk, whose full path is saved in environ variable named as **sync**.
- The transform is performed by archiving and saving in cloud space of QQ **manually**.

### Mapping

The choropleth maps part is not done yet.
